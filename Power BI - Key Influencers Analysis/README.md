# Key influencers for CO2 emissions: Analysis with Power BI
This exercise is part of Course 5: Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI from the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The case study is based on a real-world dataset containing vehicle-level CO₂ emissions data and is designed to move beyond traditional corporate scenarios, applying analytical techniques to an environmentally critical domain. It leverages authentic data to simulate an investigative analytics task focused on sustainability and environmental impact assessment.

The exercise centers on performing root cause analysis using Power BI’s AI-driven visualizations to identify the vehicle attributes that most strongly influence CO₂ emissions. Key analytical activities include exploratory data analysis in Data view, feature selection, and the creation of advanced visuals such as Key Influencers and Decomposition Trees to uncover hidden patterns and hierarchical drivers of emissions.
