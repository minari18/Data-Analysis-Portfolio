# Analysis Report for a Business Intelligence Case Study
This case study is based on the exercise *Explaining the Increase* from Course 5: Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI, part of the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The scenario uses the Adventure Works sales dataset and focuses on a real-world marketing and executive reporting use case, where sudden changes in sales performance must be rapidly investigated and explained using built-in analytical capabilities within Power BI.

The exercise concentrates on identifying and explaining anomalous sales spikes through exploratory and automated analytics in Power BI. It involves time-series analysis to detect unusual peaks, application of clustering techniques to segment products based on sales and pricing characteristics, and the use of the Analyze feature—specifically Explain the Increase—to automatically surface key drivers behind performance changes. The task reinforces core data analysis and visualization skills, including pattern recognition, anomaly detection, feature contribution analysis, and insight-driven storytelling, while highlighting the efficiency of automated analytics for generating actionable business insights in a decision-making context.
