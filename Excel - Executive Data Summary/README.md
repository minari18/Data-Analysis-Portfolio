# Excel Executive Report
This case study is taken from the Final Course Project: *Creating an Executive Data Summary* of the course “Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel”, part of the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The scenario is based on the Adventure Works business context and simulates a real-world reporting request in which an analyst must transform raw transactional data into a concise, executive-ready summary using Microsoft Excel as the primary analytical and presentation tool.

The exercise centers on restructuring and enhancing an Excel worksheet to deliver a clear executive summary of first-quarter sales performance, including year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2023. It involves applying advanced Excel techniques such as data formatting for stakeholder communication, text transformation functions, date parsing, conditional logic, and aggregation using functions like SUMIFS, IF, MONTH, and YEAR. Additionally, the project emphasizes analytical skills related to financial metrics calculation (total sales, monthly breakdowns, profit margin proxies, and percentage growth) and reinforces best practices in spreadsheet-based data analysis, ensuring accuracy, readability, and decision-oriented reporting for non-technical audiences.
