# Adventure Works Quaterly Report
This project corresponds to the *Course Project: Adventure Works Executive Summary* from Course 5: Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI, part of the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The case study is set within the Adventure Works business environment and simulates a high-pressure executive reporting scenario in which senior leadership requires an immediate, comprehensive, and insight-driven Power BI dashboard to support strategic decision-making.

The project focuses on designing an executive-level Power BI report that transforms integrated sales and customer data into actionable insights. It involves building core business intelligence visuals (tables, column and line charts, KPIs), applying time-series forecasting with seasonal adjustments and high-confidence intervals, and enabling natural language data exploration through the Q&A visual. The exercise reinforces advanced data visualization, KPI design, predictive analytics interpretation, and executive storytelling skills, emphasizing how well-structured dashboards can bridge the gap between complex datasets and strategic, data-driven decisions at the organizational level.
