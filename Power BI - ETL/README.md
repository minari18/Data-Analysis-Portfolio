# Extract, Transform and Load project in Power BI
This case study is derived from the Final Course Project: *Transforming Multiple Data Sources* of the "Extract, Transform and Load Data in Power BI" course, included on the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Program offered by Microsoft on Coursera. The exercise is based on the Adventure Works sample business scenario, a widely used analytical dataset that simulates a global sales operation. The project leverages multiple Excel-based data sources representing transactional sales data across different years, reflecting a realistic enterprise data environment where historical data is partitioned to optimize storage and performance.

The exercise focuses on executing an end-to-end ETL workflow using Power BI and Power Query to clean, transform, and integrate heterogeneous data sources. Key tasks include column pruning, data type validation, removal of empty records, detection and elimination of data anomalies through data profiling (column quality, distribution, and profile), appending fact tables across time periods, and merging transactional and detail-level tables using relational joins. The project applies core data analysis competencies such as data wrangling, anomaly detection, relational data modeling, and data quality assessment, reinforcing practical skills required for preparing reliable datasets for downstream analytics and reporting.
